#+TITLE: todo

* Vimtex stuff to steal:
- Text objects for enviornment, command, inline/display math (see
  evil-latex-textobjects)
- enviornment folding (see evil-vimish-fold, outline-minor-mode)
- good auto compilation commands (perhaps with the declaritive syntax at the
  top, might be a latexmk feature)
  - No, that's auctex's job

* Suggested defaults for cdlatex?
No, configuring cdlatex is not our job. also there's not much integration to do
with evil.

* integrated symbol folding?
No, also not our job
* Things to add to doom in another repository later
- auto compilation mappings
- view starter mappings
- i swear there were more stuff but i can't remeber at the moment
