#+TITLE: todo

* Vimtex stuff to steal:
- Text objects for enviornment, command, inline/display math (see
  evil-latex-textobjects)
- enviornment folding (see evil-vimish-fold, outline-minor-mode)
- general delimiter text object, with integration to evil-surround/evil-embrace
- csd/cse/tsd/tse commands from vimtex

* Things to add to doom in another repository later
- auto compilation mappings
- view starter mappings
- "sane defaults" for cdlatex/symbol folding
- i swear there were more stuff but i can't remeber at the moment
