** Vimtex stuff to steal:
*** Text Objects
For environments, commands/macros, inline & display math
**** DONE Steal [[https://github.com/hpdeifel/evil-latex-textobjects][evil-latex-textobjects]]
**** TODO Merge \( \[ math text objects with $ math text objects

*** General delimiter text object, with integration to evil-surround/evil-embrace
*** =csd/cse/tsd/tse= commands from vimtex
**** Environment changing
***** Vimtex way - minibuffer
Just through a prompt. That would be through the minibuffer in Emacs.
***** Using [[https://github.com/hlissner/evil-multiedit][evil-multiedit]]
Test this, and if its nice than add it as an option. We don't want
evil-multiedit as a dependency though.
*** Environment & section folding (see evil-vimish-fold, outline-minor-mode)
** Our own
*** DONE cdlatex-tab-like movement (implemented already)
*** evil-surround like bindings which support toggling inline-outline math

* Proposed
- change inside/around sub/superscript =ci^ ci_= which would jump to the closest
  sub/superscript
* Rejected

* Things to add to Doom in another repo later
** auto compilation mappings
** =TeX-fold= flag
would define bindings and advices for =TeX-fold=
** =cdlatex= flag
=cdlatex= has 4 functionalities:
- Snippets and environment templates: =fr<TAB>= => =\frac{}{}= These are made
obsolete by =yasnippet= and should be disabled.
- Tab key is configured for a general useful movement inside snippets
- Fast insertion of specific macros: =`a= => =\alpha=
- Fast accent insertion: =a'~= => =\tilde{a}=

Our cdlatex config should just disable the snippets and the tab key.
