#+TITLE: todo

* Features
** Vimtex stuff to steal:
- Text objects for enviornment, command, inline/display math (see
  [[https://github.com/hpdeifel/evil-latex-textobjects][evil-latex-textobjects]])
- general delimiter text object, with integration to evil-surround/evil-embrace
- csd/cse/tsd/tse commands from vimtex
- enviornment folding (see evil-vimish-fold, outline-minor-mode)
** Our own
*** cdlatex-tab-like movement (implemented already)
*** evil-surround like bindings which support toggling inline-outline math

* Things to add to doom in another repository later
** auto compilation mappings
** =TeX-fold= flag
would define bindings and advices for =TeX-fold=
** =cdlatex= flag
=cdlatex= has 4 functionalities:
- Snippets and environment templates: =fr<TAB>= => =\frac{}{}= These are made
obsolete by =yasnippet= and should be disabled.
- Tab key is configured for a general useful movement inside snippets
- Fast insertion of specific macros: =`a= => =\alpha=
- Fast accent insertion: =a'~= => =\tilde{a}=

our cdlatex config should just disable the snippets and the tab key.
