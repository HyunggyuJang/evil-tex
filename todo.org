#+TITLE: todo

* Vimtex stuff to steal:
** Text objects for enviornment, command, inline/display math (see evil-latex-textobjects)
** enviornment folding (see evil-vimish-fold)
** good auto compilation commands (perhaps with the declaritive syntax at the top, might be a latexmk feature)

* Suggested defaults for cdlatex?

* integrated symbol folding?
* Things to add to doom in another repository later
** auto compilation mappings
** view starter mappings
** i swear there were more stuff but i can't remeber at the moment
