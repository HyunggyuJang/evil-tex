* Features
** Text Objects
For environments, commands/macros, inline & display math
*** DONE Steal [[https://github.com/hpdeifel/evil-latex-textobjects][evil-latex-textobjects]]
*** TODO Merge \) \] math text objects with $ math text objects
So we can have a unified math
*** Make text obj work with surround
Maybe with evil-embrace?

** General delimiter text object, with integration to evil-surround/evil-embrace
** Environment changing
This is the =csd/cse/tsd/tse= commands from vimtex
*** DONE Vimtex way - minibuffer
Just through a prompt. That would be through the minibuffer in Emacs.
*** TODO Using an alias table
  After doing =cse= you would will be able to enter one letter aliases to
  immediately change the enviornment, e.g. =csea= for changing to =align=, or
  =cseE= for changing to =equation*=.
  - One mapping, e.g. =csez=, will be reserved for *entering a prompt* so you can
    fully type out the thing.
  - This is a very vimish way: i.e =csea= would be mapped to ~align~ environment
  - Aliases would be *customizable*
  - Have a *Menu for an overview* of the aliases
** Folding
- Environments
- Sections, subsections...
- Have an org-like cycle functionality
** evil-surround like bindings which support toggling inline-outline math
Also support changing =\)= =\]= to =begin{align}= and so on. We can use
~texmathp-environments~ for selection.
** DONE CDLaTeX-tab-like movement (implemented already)

* Proposed
- change inside/around sub/superscript =ci^ ci_= which would jump to the closest
  sub/superscript
  - Would not work with surround-stuff, only =c/d= commands. Just thought it
    might be useful (Say you quickly want to change a sigma index...)
- Support math environments (=begin{align}=...) with our math text objects
  - Use =tsm= to toggle between =begin{align}= and =begin{equation}= (It already
    toggles between =\(\)= and =\[\]=)

    I don't use =begin{equation}= at all, only =\[\]=. In amsmath, =\[\]= are
    defined just to yield a =begin{equation*}...=. If we support toggling
    only =equation= and =align=, getting from =\[\]= to =align= wouldn't be nice.

- not sure if we should have explanations for the surround stuff, the toggle
  stuff is non trivial but it would probably be ehough to just mention that the
  e,c,m,d text objects are compatible with evil-surround. We probably only need
  to give an example.

* Far Future
** Mark the environment being changed while user changing it
This is exactly what [[https://github.com/edkolev/evil-goggles][evil-goggles]] does. We can either:
- Just add a similar functionality to our plugin
- Add an optional integration to evil-goggles in this repo
- Add an integration with goggles in the goggles plugin (this sounds odd but
  goggles has built-in integration with evil-surround and other plugins)

* Rejected
** Using [[https://github.com/hlissner/evil-multiedit][evil-multiedit]] to change environments
Would be slow compared to aliases.

** Things to add to Doom in another repo later
*** auto compilation mappings
*** =TeX-fold= flag
would define bindings and advices for =TeX-fold=
*** =cdlatex= flag
=cdlatex= has 4 functionalities:
- Snippets and environment templates: =fr<TAB>= => =\frac{}{}= These are made
obsolete by =yasnippet= and should be disabled.
- Tab key is configured for a general useful movement inside snippets
- Fast insertion of specific macros: =`a= => =\alpha=
- Fast accent insertion: =a'~= => =\tilde{a}=

Our cdlatex config should just disable the snippets and the tab key.
